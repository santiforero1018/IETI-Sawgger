## Implementing a REST API Service with Spring Boot, Maven and Java

Implement different REST API Services to support a store products management system, implementing each CRUD Operation with Pagination for each service (Users and Products):

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

👉 Aim to reach the [Glory of Rest](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html).

👉 Use the correct methods and status codes
of [HTTP Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP).

👉 It should have at least have
the [Level 2 - HTTP Verbs of Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html).
